Vision ~ SR

(NOTE: Ideas have been trimmed to only those that haven't been implemented.  Previous ideas have been archived in the github)

Dodging:
- Hold a direction and press DODGE to dodge in that direction.
- More like a "blink" dodge?

Visions:
- Silhouette has different colors depending the duration until the actual attack.
	- Pink: fast (1 second?)
	- Yellow: medium (3 seconds?)
	- Light Green: slow (5 seconds?)

Flashback - Vision Beacons
- Press FLASH to setup a "vision beacon"
- Press FLASH again to revert time back to the vision beacon.
- Have to wait before can be used again.
- This would be cool as an optional obtainable ability in ~SR.
	- In ~SR, vision beacons are removed when entering another room.

Nondeterminism ~ SR
(SR stands for Soft Reset, Speed Run, or Senior)

Premise:
- A bomb has been set to explode in 60 minutes.  Deactivation codes and color keys are needed to disarm it, all of which are found in the villain's lair.
	- In Majora's Mask, time limit is 18 minutes * 3 = 54 minutes.
- Appears to be a miniature Metroid game at first.  Need to collect a number of color keys (physical) to get to the bomb room.
	- Also collect glyphs (information) that seem to serve no purpose, until the true final door.
	- Spell out a password when arranged in the progress menu?  Need to guess the password and type it out?
		- Need to have a bare minimum of glyphs in order to guess.
	- Similar to Gold Orbs from An Untitled Story
- Game is similar to the movie "Edge of Tomorrow"
- First area of the game has a huge variety of paths and secrets to keep the player from becoming bored.
	- Early on branch off into multiple short paths, all but one are dead ends.  Can remember which path is the real one on next play attempt.
	- Can use earned abilities for shortcuts, which also happen to go through physical upgrade rooms.

- Oracle has a calculating personality, but is amused by instigating slight annoyance from others.
	- Oracle is crippled with fear if she's unable to predict the future, however.
		- Explains while Oracle hates sleeping, since she can't predict things that happen to her while asleep.
		- Happens when something appears to happen that she can't predict.
			- e.g. viruses that cause her to unknowingly hallucinate.
			- e.g. quantum attacks.
		- When she gets unsure of how to continue, Wally's confidence encourages her to keep going despite uncertainties.
		- She overcomes this fear at the end of the game.
	- Oracle is slow to remember things.
		- Visions of the future are more useful than memories of the past, so they prioritized when recalling information.
		- Wally's rebuttal:
			- But memories are, in a way, the only thing we *can* be sure of.  We know for a fact that what has happened, happened.  The past is set in stone, and there's nothing that can be done to change it.
			- It's the future that is uncertain.  The random choices we make all influence events to come.  Your visions are never 100% true, correct?  When you realize what will happen, you change how you act, which in turn modifies the future a tiny bit. 
		- Wally's challenge:
			- When you were at (place that gets destroyed), there was a picture of (...).  What color was (...)?  And I'm only going to respond with yes or no.
			- Need to pick answer from a range of colors.
			- Can technically constantly revert and win with trial and error.
				- If win, Wally will say "good thing you didn't cheat"

- Oracle doesn't forsee events without forseeing every event that leads up to it first.
- Beginning of game: Oracle gets a vision of a bomb detonating in (1 hour?), but doesn't know what causes it.  This is concerning because she doesn't know what events lead up to it.

- Once Oracle realizes that her memories and visions are being tampered with, begins to not trust her own visions, memories, friends.
- Oracle and the Player become suspicious of Wally, need to decide if Wally is a malicious AI or not.

- The younger Oracle is, the more powerful her future sense powers are.
	
Final boss gimmick:
- Splitscreen: one part is the gameplay as usual, other part is the actual current time.
- There is a timer ticking down that does not go backwards when going back in time.
- Current time is Infant Oracle talking to her father on their homeworld.
	- Use realistic graphics instead of pixelated to show this is actually the real current time, and that everything else was a vision by Oracle.
- She has little time left before making a big decision: whether or not she should accept her father's mission.
	- Mission involves being sent to earth and defeating the final boss.
	- Oracle is told to accept only if she knows she can succeed.
	- Time is running out for Oracle to decide what to do, as shown by the timer.
- During the boss fight, Oracle and father are talking in the "current time" part.
	- Oracle explains she's so close.  She's been trying for so long to find a path that arrives at victory.
	- Oracle explains all the good times she'll have with Wally, her only friend.
		- On Oracle's homeworld, people regarded Oracle as a freak for her future powers and calculating personality, so she was never able to make friends.
	- Father insists that it's not worth it if she ends up dying.
- If Oracle dies during the boss fight (likely to happen during first attempt), Oracle answers father's question.
	- Answers yes anyway.
	- This is the first time Oracle agrees to doing something without being certain what will happen next.

Conversation mechanic:
- Important conversations between Oracle and Wally will pause gameplay.
	- Similar to codec calls from MGS.
- Sometimes asked questions and player needs to choose an answer.
- Secret: Can hold FLASHBACK to go back in time during conversations.
- Secret: Hold (...) to bring up a simple minigame to play while talking (like Snake, similar to the youtube easter egg)

Map Ideas:
- Short hidden path from start to a physical key (for the introduction)
- Medium-short hidden path from start to Booster (physical upgrade that's best to get as soon as possible)
	- Goes through Sky area
	- Falling will set you way back to a bottom screen, so be sure to use a Flashback before that happens.

- Completed map should look more like a web than a blob (as in Super Metroid).  This will make routes a lot clearer.
	- Hidden shortcuts in-between routes, of course.
	- Should be many routes close to the starting area and the area where the Booster is acquired.

Puzzles:
- Key words or codes are stored in a "memory bank", accessed from menu
- Use in other parts of the world

Scenarios:
- Deactivate code is actually an anagram, which are other instructions
ULEB RODO ERFI NNIE HENT JMUP ROUF
->
BLUE DOOR FIRE NINE THEN JUMP FOUR
- A certain area is destroyed ~7 minutes in
	- Need to explore it before that happens
	- Or can prevent it from being destroyed altogether
-

- Advertised as "15 minutes until your world ends"
- Countdown is actually to when protagonist's life is terminated, not when the world blows up.
	- Shown when giant counter in a room late in the game shows how old protagonist's life is.  Add it to the countdown timer gets exactly 20 years

Map:
- Standard map that gets filled in as player finds rooms.
- Map is information, so does not revert back when warping to a previous time.
- Records location of physical upgrades and keys
	- Also marks if the item was picked up
	- If found item (thus picking it up), then warped to a previous time, then the item's location would appear on the map, but it would not be marked as if it was obtained.

- Silhouette has different colors depending the duration until the actual attack.
	- Pink: fast (1 second?)
	- Yellow: medium (3 seconds?)
	- Light Green: slow (5 seconds?)
- Some enemies have an "invincible mode" for a few seconds.  They can't be defeated or altered.
	- This means every attack they make while in this mode is forseen.

- Can place bombs or mines in preparation for enemies appearing.
- Have enemies that appear or warp out of nowhere.

- Scenario: need to race to something.  There are multiple paths there, with one path seemingly the best.
	- But on the way there, an obstacle moves (e.g. falls) that makes another path the best.  Need to flashback to the the beginning and pick the right path.
- Scenario: one window of opportunity for something.  Need to jump through at the precise window, and use flashback to adjust for the window.

Skills:
- Dash ability

- "Shinespark" charged by falling
	
- Charge shot (stronger shot, breaks other obstacles)
	- Hold B for a duration
	- Probably easy for the player to figure out on their own
- Omega shot (very strong shot at close range, then splits/fans out for less damage at long range)
	- Press B twice, then hold B for a long duration
	- Goes to charge shot like usual, then omega shot
- Shield flash (puts up a gradually growing circular barrier that goes away after a short duration)
	- While having a charge or omega shot ready, press RIGHT, UP, LEFT, DOWN or LEFT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN in order.
	- Able to go through some unavoidable obstacles.
	- Can't charge anything or use concentration while the shield is up.
- Somersault jump (some extra jump height)
	- While running in a direction, hold the opposite direction and press A
- Wall run (briefly run up walls, given enough upwards velocity)
	- Hold UP while hugging a wall with large (negative) enough y velocity.
	- Y velocity goes to 0 slower than the effect of gravity.  At a certain point wall run will stop.  So wall runs will be longer by having a greater starting velocity.
	- Can press JUMP while wall running to preform a wall jump.
- Wing glide (greatly lowers descent speed)
	- Hold UP while falling
- Air hop (small double jump)
	- While in the air, press DOWN, UP, A
	- Can only do one before touching the ground again
	- Be be followed up by a small wall run
- Fire dive (downward slam from the air)
	- While having a charge or omega shot ready and in the air, press DOWN twice in a row
	- Landing lag when hit ground, but can press A to leap out of it, as in SM3DW
	- Hitting a slope will bounce dive horizontally?
- Concentration (health regen)
	- Hold DOWN for a duration while at low health to regain some back.
- Concentration+ (replaces Concentration, restores more health)
	- Same as concentration, but rapidly tap DOWN while health is being restored to restore more.
- (BAD IDEA) Strip Suit (takes robot suit off)
	- Press UP, DOWN, UP rapidly while on the ground to take the suit off
	- Severely decreased health and severely decreased firepower
	- Can swim in water
- (BAD IDEA) Rebuild suit (when suit is stripped, put suit back on)
	- Hold B while staying still for a duration
- (BAD IDEA) Death warp (upon dying, can transmit consciousness to another body in the room)
	- While in death animation, hold A and B and press UP.
	- Need to then direct soul to another body (looks exactly the same)
- Grav Shift (slows down speed of everything around player)
	- Hold A and B while holding DOWN for a duration

- Strip: Suit comes off revealing Oracle's tiny larval form.
	- Can crawl in tight corners and learn info, but can't fight.
	- Can't save.
	- Idea is to learn info then revert back to a time before the strip.
- Commandeer: While in larval form, can crawl into another suit and use that.
	- Secret and situational; only used once.


- "Final challenge" portion where most of the 10 minutes is spent on a new linear level testing all the abilities?

- Battletoads hoverbike reference
	- Visions to see the flashing walls coming

- Majora's Mask reference
	- Screen will resize slightly smaller and smaller, similar to how the viewport gets smaller in Majora's Mask when the next day starts

- Blind section
	- Screen is completely black, but you get dialogue from Wally (who can see).
	- Use his guidance to get you through the darkness.
	- Viruses area?

- Oracle can optionally taunt after defeating a wave of enemies?
	- To activate, just don't press anything and be idle as the last enemy dies

- Players shouldn't feel pressured for time while exploring, if they use chamber flashbacks correctly.
	- Time is an issue only when collecting the physical keys

- Hold a button (shoulder button?  Right stick) to quickly bring up the map (pausing the game), and release the button to get rid of the map (resuming the game).
	- Right stick: direction held is the direction the map comes in from.

- Level design idea: 2 paths through a room, one path has hard wave challenges, the other path doesn't.  The path that does is consistent through multiple passes through that room.

- Collectible cards featuring all the enemies.
	- Finding a card slightly increases the damage dealt to them.
	- Card has an ID on them, so they can be remembered (information) after being found.
	- But a special symbol will appear next to the card when looked it in the Progress menu if they still physically have it.

- Players should be solving puzzles, not finding where to go next.

x portal

Enemies needed (sorted by priority):
o Pengrunt with rocket boots
o Tank bear that fires bombs, some are fake/duds
o Samurai with delayed causality attacks

o More knockback on enemies


o Puzzle: spin windmill to move platforms in a loop.
	o Shoot to spin, direction based on position the windmill is shot.

o Oracle getting the vision of the world ending does not happen abruptly at the 1 hour mark (would be annoying for the player)
	- Walk into an ominous small room, but there's nothing there.
	- Upon leaving back the way you came, you're now suddenly in a very ominous, glitchy-aesthetic room.
	- Trapped here: Fall down a pit upon entering.
	- Player hitting Pause (to try to Flashback out of the room) is what triggers the vision.
	- First broken pause screen appears, glitches out, cuts to black.
	- Then vision happens.  The Meltdown happens, but it's all in grayscale with no sound.
	- Text appears in red saying "you saw this coming", "you could have stopped this", "please save us"
	- Vision ends with Oracle freaking out in the ship at the beginning of the game.
		- Afterwards Wally will direct Oracle down an obscure path to the left of the ship the player wouldn't likely figure out on their first try.
	o This entire sequence is technically optional.  Just don't go into the ominous room.
	
o Boss fight section: create obbs that will heal the boss.  Need to destroy the orbs before they get to the boss.


o Enemy attacks that drain phase

o Lab sequence break puzzle:
	- Passcode: turn on a certain number of lights in a series.
	- Find out this code later, but when you first find it there's an equation in the room (on computer screen)
		- Random for each save file
	- Solve the equation, convert solution to binary, that's the answer to the lights.

o Icicle obstacles:
	- Can be pointed down, up, sideways.
	- Act as platforms.  Shooting them enough times will break them.
	- One item requires player to keep certain icicles intact.
	- Puzzle: need to flip switch? at bottom of well, then climb out of it to go through the door? the switch? opened.
		- Need to break horizontal icicles to get down.
		- Will be trapped down there unless icicles were broken in a way so that player can climb back up.
		- Worst case scenario: use chamber flashback to escape if truly stuck.

o Beach area:
	- Very small, like 1 or 2 rooms wide.
	- Thin cover of ice.  Invisible wall to the far left or right
	- Use Flare Dive to break through the ice.  Secret cave in there.
		- Water controls the same as normal controls, except for floatier jumps
		
o Puzzle: Block Bats
	- Harmless indestructible blocks that have wings.  Player can stand on them.
	- Shooting them will cause them to move one "tile" in that direction.
		- Background (no parallax) will show which the "tiles" the bats can travel to.
	- When two bats are close to each other (one "tile", diagonally counts), they will react.
		- Will shoot short beams of plasma.
		- Directions extend the line that the centers of the two bats rest on.
		- Plasma breaks the same obstacles that the guided missile would break.

o Idea to fill "secret areas": moving to a location just adds a conversation with Wally to the Talk page.

o Puzzle where need to kill an enemy to get through an area.  But the enemy appears to be invincible.  Need to find its creature card nearby to weaken it so that it can be killed.
o Secret language is based on Enochian
	- Enochian is written from right to left, so flip symbols
o One ambush is impossible to beat at first.  Need to escape.
	- Can only escape in the direction player entered from.
	- However, come back here later with a new weapon and the ambush can be defeated.  Then player can progress forward there.
o "Glitch" walls that prevent progress until the glitch is defeated can be extended to glitch platforms that help the player.
	- After glitch is defeated, platforms go away, and need a different strategy to get through a room.
	- MIGHT BE A BAD IDEA: fastest route cannot be using the glitch platforms
o Use the energy grenades to destroy platforms below enemies, causing them to fall into spikes, etc.
