Enemy Attacks:
(Need to be really hard to predict normally, but reasonable with the vision ability)
(If enemies were penguins they'd be easier to animate)
(Evil penguins, seals, bears)
- Bullet tracers
	- Heavy weapons: slow, high HP, fire gatling gun where each individual bullet can be dodged
		- Bears with gatling guns on their backs.
			- Shoot at them from behind to destroy the gun.
	- Flyers: fly from point to point, spreading bullets on the way there.
		- Similar to those things from Project Eclipse
		- Move with easeInOutQuad
		- Penguins with jet boots
			- Aim at the feet to have them spiral out of control for a quick death.
- Appearing from a portal
	- All enemies spawn from a portal.
	- Portal damages player when opened.
- Teleportation attacks
	- Delayed causality attacks (slashes take effect at random points)
	- Cyborg ninja penguins with giant swords
- Airstrikes
- (BAD IDEA) Bombs that explode at random intervals
- Lightning paths
	- Seal that looks like a floating zapfish
- Lightning cloud
	- Is a cloud that floats above, dropping lightning attacks at "random"
- Whack-a-mole type enemies, popping up at "random" spots
- Wall climbers: shimmy up and down a vertical wall.
- Ceiling stickers: move left to right on a ceiling.
	- Yo-yo attack from the ceiling in any direction
- Bomb puzzle:
	- Need to hit special symbol, 1 of 4 that rotate around the enemy.
	- Hit the wrong one:
		- The correct one flashes on the enemy, then it explodes in a huge explosion that launches seekers at the player that are impossible to dodge.
		- Strategy: after hitting the wrong one, flashback to before you shot it and hit the correct one.
	- Hit the right one:
		- Enemy is defeated just like normal.
- Fake projectiles:
	- A bunch of projectiles appear to fall around the player.  But Vision will show all but one of them, which is fake.



Special Enemy Attacks:
- Quantum Attacks
	- Produce many fake visions and one real one.  Need to use pattern recognition to determine the real one?
- Vision Viruses
	- Attacks that appear on the screen itself, and don't move with the camera or through flashbacks.
	- In lore these are viruses in Oracle's programming.
	- In ~SR, happen at random the longer you play the game, similar to the ghosts in An Untitled Story.
- Music related where a secret message is heard when playing the level in reverse?
	- Attacks are sound-based.  Instead of visual silhouettes, Vision will detect music.
	- High pitched = high attack.  Low pitched = low attack.
	- Quick rhythm: almost continuous attack.  Slow rhythm: attack appears every other second or so.
	- "Sonata"?
		- Used mind control on enemies, which is why they're all hostile.
- A boss enemy that can also flashback.
	- Uses a similar phase mechanic, need to drain their phase.
	- "The Salesman"?

Enemy Behavior:
- Place static "Spots" all over the map.
- Every movement from an enemy starts at one spot and ends at another.
- Gives us the ability to predict where enemy will be at a certain time.
