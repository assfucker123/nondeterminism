Enemy Attacks:
(Need to be really hard to predict normally, but reasonable with the vision ability)
(If enemies were penguins they'd be easier to animate)
(Evil penguins, seals, bears, dolphins, wolves, shrimp)
- Bullet tracers
	- Heavy weapons: slow, high HP, fire gatling gun where each individual bullet can be dodged
		- Bears with gatling guns on their backs.
			- Shoot at them from behind to destroy the gun.
	- Flyers: fly from point to point, spreading bullets on the way there.
		- Similar to those things from Project Eclipse
		- Move with easeInOutQuad
		- Penguins with jet boots
			- Aim at the feet to have them spiral out of control for a quick death.
- Appearing from a portal
	- All enemies spawn from a portal.
	- Portal damages player when opened.
- Teleportation attacks
	- Delayed causality attacks (slashes take effect at random points)
	- Cyborg ninja penguins with giant swords
- Airstrikes
- (BAD IDEA) Bombs that explode at random intervals
- Lightning paths
	- Seal that looks like a floating zapfish
- Lightning cloud
	- Is a cloud that floats above, dropping lightning attacks at "random"
- Whack-a-mole type enemies, popping up at "random" spots
	- Pop out one spot -> jump to another?
- Wall climbers: shimmy up and down a vertical wall.
	- Yo-yo attack: can chain yo-yo stuff
- Ceiling stickers: move left to right on a ceiling.
	- Yo-yo attack from the ceiling in any direction
- Bomb puzzle:
	- Need to hit special symbol, 1 of 4 that rotate around the enemy.
	- Hit the wrong one:
		- The correct one flashes on the enemy, then it explodes in a huge explosion that launches seekers at the player that are impossible to dodge.
		- Strategy: after hitting the wrong one, flashback to before you shot it and hit the correct one.
	- Hit the right one:
		- Enemy is defeated just like normal.
- Fake projectiles:
	- A bunch of projectiles appear to fall around the player.  But Vision will show all but one of them, which is fake.
- Random exploders:
	- Things that move around and sometimes explode.
- Smash Greninja inspired
- Pikachu + Charizard Y inspired
- When attacks happen are predictable, but not which direction.
- The guy that goes left and right in mega man, but will randomly boost in the opposite direction.
- Goombers: just hop back and forth without much threat
	- Based on spheal
	- Maw Goombers will occasionally do a really powerful bullet attack from the mouth.
- All enemies have red eyes, controlled by Sonata
- Continuous missile launcher: keeps launching a few missiles per second for a while.
	- Creates vision of attack while also preforming another attack.

Special Enemy Attacks:
- Quantum Attacks
	- Produce many fake visions and one real one.  Need to use pattern recognition to determine the real one?
- Vision Viruses
	- Attacks that appear on the screen itself, and don't move with the camera or through flashbacks.
	- In lore these are viruses in Oracle's programming.
	- In ~SR, happen at random the longer you play the game, similar to the ghosts in An Untitled Story.
- Music related where a secret message is heard when playing the level in reverse?
	- Attacks are sound-based.  Instead of visual silhouettes, Vision will detect music/sound cues.
	- High pitched = high attack.  Low pitched = low attack.
	- Quick rhythm: almost continuous attack.  Slow rhythm: attack appears every other second or so.
		- Or attacks line up with a staff in the background?
	- "Sonata"?
		- Used mind control on enemies, which is why they're all hostile.
	- When she speaks, there will be actual voice acting, instead of just the text scroll.
		- Booming voice, does damage, even in cutscenes.
		- Mouth appears to be sown shut most of the game.  Early in boss fight, she cuts it open with one of her note sickles, then the real fight begins.
	- 
	- Secret: mute sound in options to make Sonata unable to deal sound-based damage, makes her angry.

- Boss enemy whose weakness is told to you after you die (but before GAME OVER appears)
	- Need to flashback just before dying for good to utilize the information.

- Geiger boss fight
	- Uses quantum attacks: produce many visions (e.g. of attack going in multiple directions), and selects one at random to actually be the true attack.
	- If reverting back to before a vision was chosen, a different vision will be chosen.
	- Only damaged by charge shots or energy grenades.
	- Will teleport to one of several locations on a row.
		- Trick is to charge up a shot and go to one side of the room, fire when he'll appear.  The shot will intersect all of the visions.
		- Better idea: move to the center of the room so no matter what he won't be too far away.

- Sonata boss fight
	- Background looks like a musical staff.
		- A vertical line periodically moves from left to right on the beat of the song.
	- Rhythm attacks have audio tells.  Loud noises happens on certain beats.
		- Tells are synced up to the background music and the vertical line in the background.
		- Next measure the actual attack happens, with large columns of distortion effects happening on the same beats of the song.
	- Pitch attacks have audio tells.  A long loud tone plays for the entire measure.
		- Next measure the actual attack happens, with a large row of distortion that matches the pitch of the tone.
		- Y coordinate matches where the corresponding note would be on the staff in the background.

- The Salesman boss fight.
	- Can also flashback.
	- Uses a similar phase mechanic, need to drain their phase.

- Final boss fight
	- Fight takes place in gigantic scary cave with several heart-shaped orbs.
		- Similar to Master Core.
		- There are 10 orbs, labeled 0...9
	- Uses time travel: resembles saving and loading save states in an emulator.
		- The boss is easy to hit and deal damage to, but it'll just reload a save state from earlier.
	- When loading a save state, will say "STATE # LOADED" in the corner, and "STATE # SAVED" for saving, where # is in [0, 9].
		- Similar to Omega Flowey.
	- The states are saved in the orbs around the cave.  When an orb is destroyed, a state can't be saved to it.
	- Once all the orbs are destroyed, save states can't be used, and the boss is finally vulnerable.
	- Custom health bar also shows the status of the 10 orbs.
		- For each orb, shows if a state has been saved to it, and shows if the orb was destroyed or not.
	- Getting to each orb is a review of a skill obtained during the game.

Enemy Behavior:
- Place static "Spots" all over the map.
- Every movement from an enemy starts at one spot and ends at another.
- Gives us the ability to predict where enemy will be at a certain time.
