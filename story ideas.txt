Tentative opening:

- Wally and Oracle flying to the island.
- Oracle senses an ambush while flying.  Climbs from the inside to the outside of their ship.
	- Requires player to jump, shoot out door to outside.
- Meets the ice bird enemy.  Comic relief, mentions Sonata.
- Oracle explains how the fight is going to go down.
	- Oracle: "Sherivice, I know we are not permitted to be here.  But it is of utmost importance we arrive at a facility located on this island, with or without Sonata's approval."
	- Sherivice: "Stop there!  Nobody leaves nor leaves this island without the blessing of Empress Sonata!  I, the admirable Sherivice, will personally great all violators with brutal force!"
	- S: "...Hey, you knew my name already!  Where'd you hear it?"
	- O: "You told me when I foresaw that rehearsed monologue of yours."
	- S: "...?"
	- O: I can see the future.  And every living creature on this planet is going to perish unless we--"
	- S: "So what, you're psychic or something?  ReALly?  Do you know results from crossing me?"
	- O: "Well after ignoring everything I say, you unwisely challenge me to a fight.  You then attempt to hit me with various ice-related attacks, most of which miss.  Finally you fire a projectile that is so hilariously off-course that it will circle back and hit you in the face, granting me a pitifully easy victory."
	- S: "NyyeEHHH?  Do you take me for some kind of senseless weakling?  I'll crush your stupid metallic face in for that!"
	- (battle starts)
- Fights ice bird as tutorial boss.  Introduction to visions (ice ball attacks, ice beam attacks)
- One attack has ice bird fire a projectile in a curvy pattern.
- Cutscene interrupt fight near the end.
	- S: "Whew... j-just let me hit you already!  You're dodging all my ice shards before I even throw them... I suppose you really can see the future..."
	- S: "Heh heh heh, but watch this!" (puts one wing over eyes) "You won't be able to see my moves coming when even I can't see them coming!"
	- O: "How did you even arrive at that conclusion.  That is not how it works--"
	- S: "Clever huh?  Your tricks won't work now!  Prepare to die punk!"
- Ice bird fires projectiles in random directions, but visions of them still appear.
- One of these projectiles curve around and accidentally hit the ice bird, defeating it.
	- Has a funny sprite when defeated.  Doesn't die, but flies off the edge of the screen.  Will probably be a future boss.
	- "WAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH"

- Mystery guy that was sending Oracle, her suit, the ship, etc. is referred to as "NPC" before his real name Grygor is revealed.
	- Player will think NPC stands for non-playable character.
	- NPC actually stands for NP-Complete, which describes problems that can be verified in polynomial time.





* Basic jumping and shooting controls.

* Fight enemies, acquire phase pickup.

** Vision ability is introduced. (Phase meter does not decrease over time)

* Phase crystals are introduced.
	- Shooting a phase crystal will cause a phase pickup to fly out.

* Fight enemies, max out phase meter.

* Chamber Save.

* Encounter large door that obviously requires password to unlock (e.g. stepping on tiles in a certain order)
	- Gamedev cheating: make this impossible to guess until going into the room with the password.

* Find health upgrade (is a physical upgrade, so will be lost when reverting before a time it was acquired)
	- Technically optional, but very hard to miss.

** Flashback ability introduced.
	- There is a truss bridge over a vat of quicksand.
		- Quicksand drags victims towards the middle, then down under to kill them.
		- Can't move or jump in quicksand, but can shoot.
	- Mines have been placed all over the bridge.  Walking into one will cause the bridge to collapse, dropping Oracle into the quicksand.
	- Need to use Flashback ability to revert back to before the mine was set off.
		- Need to "cheat" and make sure player has enough phase at this point.
		- Reward a lot of phase to player in fight immediately before this, and give the player enough phase if they're really stupid before then.
		- NO Phase Crystals nearby.  This wouldn't help.
	- To solve puzzle: shoot boulders on the side in a way that Oracle can climb to the top of the truss bridge and walk over the mines.

* Find decryptor upgrade (is information that unlocks one of Oracle's innate abilities, so it not lost when reverting)
	- Something obvious but really easy to grasp, e.g. charge shot.
	- Upgrade is mandatory to get to the next room.

** Chamber Flashback ability introduced.
	- Find password for the large door on the wall.
	- Tutorial screen pops up acknowledging it's obvious what to do next, suggests Chamber Flashback in order to get back to the door quickly.
	- Shortcuts (shown as prompts during flashbacks):
		- FLASHBACK + DODGE to automatically revert to the last Chamber/save point.
		- FLASHBACK + START to open up the Time Tree in the pause menu and select from there.

* Unlock door by inputting the password.
	- Wally is surprised she knows it, Oracle explains she had a vision of finding the room with the password.
	- Password: fruit related.  Make it a theme?  Match Toucade?

* Simple puzzle involving charge shot.
	- Wally surprised again.  Oracle explains decryptor code.
	- Wally reiterates that information is saved when doing a flashback.
	- If Oracle picked up the health upgrade but forgot to get it again after the chamber flashback, she will explain her vision and acknowledge that her health didn't increase.
	- Wally reiterates that physical upgrades are not saved when doing a flashback.  (But you can go back and get them again)
	- Wally mentions he's going to stop getting surprised when Oracle does something she's never done before.
	
...

** Dodge ability decryptor (Hold direction and press R to dodge in that direction)
	- Can be used to get a bit more height/distance.

...

** Grenade decryptor (Hold direction and press X/Triangle to throw)

...
	
* Grenade distance decryptor (tap direction before pressing to throw the grenade a greater distance) (optional)

...

** Wall run decryptor (Hold up to run up wall for a short duration)

...

* Dodge slide decryptor (maintain momentum when using the dodge ability at an angle towards the ground) (optional)

...

*** Booster upgrade (allows use of several decrypted abilities that require the booster)

** Super speed (requires booster) (greatly increases run speed after running for a few seconds)

...

** Grenade flashback aim decryptor (choose where and when a grenade will explode by pressing X/Triangle during a flashback) (optional?)

...
	
** Glide decryptor (requires booster) (greatly reduces fall speed for a duration)

...

* Precision flashback decryptor (can essentially make and load save points at the cost of phase) (optional)

...

** Double jump (requires booster)

...

*** Strip suit (reduces Oracle to her larval form, allowing her to travel through tight corridors)

===========================================

At ____ hours/minutes in, gameplay is spontaneously interrupted with a cutscene of the world blowing up.  Neither Oracle nor Wally expect this to happen so soon.

- Next scene is back at the start of the game, with Oracle being shocked.
- Explains that world ends at exactly ____ time, and that they don't know if it's even possible to collect all the ____ in time.
- Wally just received the saucer, so he couldn't get here any earlier.
- Oracle admits she lied and doesn't actually know the outcome of the mission.  Something is "blocking" Oracle from seeing further.
	- Foreshadowing: Oracle falls asleep just before landing the finishing blow on the final boss.
- Oracle shares everything she (and the player) found out about the map.
(time map is shown on screen)
- Wally notes that Oracle seemed to spend a long time going from (current/first area) to (early area with the first ____), even though they're not far from each other.
- Wally suggests that Oracle (the player) use her new abilities to find a shortcut to the early area.  That will give her more time to collect all the ___.
	- Wally: Try exploring this area close by.  Your new abilities might let you get through.
- There is a mandatory decryptor on the path there.

===========================================

Important early conversations to close plot-holes:

- Oracle waiting for others to finish speaking:
	- Wally: I was wondering, if you know everything I'm about to say--
	- Oracle: --why do I not finish your sentences?
	- Wally: ... yes.
	- Oracle: Well clearly I am able to do so.  You are curious as to why I wait for you to finish before speaking?"
	- Wally: Well if you know what I'm going to tell you--
	- Oracle: --then why say anything at all?
	- Wally: ... then... s-stop that!
	- Oracle: Heh heh.  You now have your answer.  You understandably do not appreciate getting interrupted.  Forming a hostile relationship between us is not advantageous for either of us, so I prefer we converse like ordinary humans.
	- Wally: Good point.  But how cool would it be if you acknowledge everything I'm about to say before I take the time to let the words come out?  Conversation would be so efficient!
	- Oracle: I am not a mind reader Wally.  I will not understand you if you do not actually speak anything.
	- Wally: That is true.

- Wally and Oracle not arriving earlier if it's eventually revealed that there's huge time pressure:
	- Wally: A functional saucer spontaneously appearing on my doorstep just yesterday?  No that part is true.  It's probably from the same "stork" that sent you and your suit.
	- Oracle: You did not build the suit and you did not build the saucer.  And you clearly only have a child's grasp on how any of them work.  Wally is there anything you *can* do?
	- Wally: I told you.  I tinker.  I modify, take part, and learn.  Actually constructing large projects are for no-life mega nerds with oodles of grant money.  And I don't have any grant money.

- Other early conversation:
	- Wally: ...
	- Oracle: I am not easily surprised.

- Other early conversation:
	- Wally: So Oracle... do we win?  We make it out alive after defeating the bad guys and stuff right?
	- Oracle: Of course!

- Isn't Oracle doing everything?
	- Wally: Well, my combat abilities aren't as good as yours Oracle.  Erm, it would be best for me to just stay here in the saucer where it's warm.  And provide, you know, support.
	- Oracle: That seems like the best way to maximize your usefulness.
	- Wally: Do I detect sarcasm?  You think I won't be that much of a help stuck here huh?
	- Oracle: That is an odd way to interpret what I said.  But I do not disagree.
	- Wally: If you know everything that will happen there's not a lot to help out with.
	- Oracle: An extra brain to process information cannot be unhelpful.  I urge you to remain here.
	- Oracle: Additionally if you leave now you do not, uh, stay together.
	- Wally: Oh... thank you.  Hey, at least we can keep each other from getting bored.  No matter how prepared you must be, it'll be better if you're less lonely right!
	- Oracle: I appreciate the company Wally.

- What happens to the "current timeline" when Oracle does a flashback?
	- Wally: Hmm, you seem to be in a tight spot.  Do you see a way out?
	- Oracle: No I do not.
	- Wally: What happens now?  Do we just stay here forever?  Until the world ends?
	- Oracle: ...
	- Wally: Our chance at a happy ending, all gone because of some stupid mistake?  No blaze of glory, we can't even really say we tried our best!  Oracle is there really no way back?
	- Oracle: ... well...
	- Wally: Oh hell no, please don't pull that time travel vision crap here.  I know how it works, you've told me enough times.  But when you do a flashback you're leaving the rest of the world in the dust!
	- Oracle: Wally--
	- Wally: Yes, your body stays here, whatever.  You're not going back to the past, but at the same time, *you* are retreating back to a time when the world isn't screwed over.
	- Oracle: Wally.  If it makes you feel better, none of this is actually happening.  This entire universe at this moment is just an illusion, a figment of how I perceive the world to be.
	- Wally: ...
	- Oracle: Meaning you are not real.
	- Wally: That doesn't make me feel better at all!
	- Oracle: I know.
	- Wally: So now what?  I spend my last remaining moments alive knowing nothing was worth it because I don't even exist?
	- Oracle: ... yeah?
	- Wally: ...
	- Oracle: You should not think about it too hard.

Opening conversation; Oracle spoiling the game?  BETTER IDEA: Have this conversation later, once it's been well established that Oracle can see the future.
- Oracle boasts that she already knows she'll complete the mission and beat the bad guys.  Offers to let Wally know how it happens.
- Wally hesitates.  Confirming how Oracle saves the world would put his worries at ease, but it would ruin the excitement of experiencing it for himself.
- Player now gets to choose to keep it a secret or to reveal everything to Wally (thus spoiling the game for the player).
	- If chooses yes, Oracle explains everything she think will happen (defeating Grygor, Grygor actually being Mr. X, defeating Sonata, 4 orbs, fixing the shield, etc.).
	- However, Oracle does not mention anything involving her glitches (the world being blown up early, glitch bosses, The Salesman, etc.), because she doesn't know about them yet.
	- Wally will be annoyed, and will remember this choice.

- Oracle's mind (is like a computer) (and Oracle has a bad memory) (and some character development):
	- Wally: This has been bothering me for a while, and I'd just like to apologize.  
	- Oracle: For what?
	- Wally: When I first received you from NPC, I just saw you as a research specimen.  It wasn't until your suit came and we could communicate that I started treating you like a person.  Or rather, a friend.
	- Oracle: It is understandable.  Even as a larva my future sensing abilities were most likely very prominent and interesting.  So  naturally you were curious about me and wanted to learn more.  Oddly I somewhat enjoy the attention received by being placed under a microscope.
	- Wally: Er... I meant all the other ways I experimented with your larva form.  Thinking about it in retrospect makes me a little sick.
	- Oracle: What?  Do not hide information from me Wally.
	- Wally: Hiding?  But you know already.  You were there!
	- Oracle: From what you have said, yes.
	- Wally: From what I...?  You don't remember what happened, do you?
	- Oracle: Well I remember important events that happen to me very clearly, so obviously what you did in the past must not have been as significant as you think!
	- Wally: Oh man, no fooling?  You have a bad memory, don't you?
	- Oracle: ...go back to talking about your guilt-ridden examinations, please.
	- Wally: Nah.  Besides, you said yourself they weren't significant.
	- Oracle: ...
	- Wally: A bad memory, huh?  You know, your mind structure was pretty irregular.  Maybe this has something to do with it.
	- Oracle: Pardon?
	- Wally: I couldn't figure out much from my examinations, but I learned some very interesting things about how your mind works.  You're more extraordinary than you might think, Oracle.
	- Wally: For humans, and most creatures I imagine, information is contained in a neural network within their brain.  But your mind's equivalent to a human brain's medial temporal lobe is actually a vast array of semi-conductive materials.  Astonishingly, the living tissue in your mind has more in common with a computer than the brains of most other life forms on this planet.
	- Oracle: Swell.  Is this actually useful to know?
	- Wally: Hey, this structure is probably the reason you're "compatible" with the suit you use.  It's all very cool.
	- Oracle: Haha, I agree!
	- Oracle: And to be clear, my memory is not inadequate.  Data I collect from visions of the future are prioritized over data from memories of the past.  Thus I "remember" future events as easily as ordinary creatures remember past events.
	- Oracle: Memories for me are like... dreams for humans.  Not that important, and easily forgotten to make space for more vital information.
	- Wally: Memories aren't vital?  What about learning from your mistakes?
	- Oracle: Ha ha ha ha.  I do not make mistakes Wally.  I foresee all possible problems and prevent them from becoming reality.
	- Wally: Sheesh, how humble.  And I don't think visions should be prioritized over memories as much as you think they should.
	- Oracle: What makes you say that?
	- Wally: Well first of all, your visions are never 100 percent true, aren't they?  Your actions in a vision are different than what actually happens, since you react to what you perceived.
	- Wally: Meanwhile, memories of the past are set in stone.  There's no going back in time to change things.  While there are many possible outcomes the future can take, there's only one past.
	- Wally: And hey, wouldn't it be great to have to have memories of things and people you like or dislike?  Maybe it'll let you have more of a personality, and you'll act less like a robot.
	- Oracle: You underestimate the benefits of clairvoyance, but those are good points.  Also... I am not a robot.
	- Wally: Sorry, that last part was a little rude.
	- Oracle: Hmm.
	
- Foreshadowing final boss against Tom, Wally's dad.
	- Final boss is essentially fighting against someone using an emulator and abusing save states.
	- Foreshadow by saying dad really enjoyed playing retro games, although his methods of acquiring them were somewhat immoral (implying ROMs on emulators).

- Grygor (pre-boss fight): "It will take more than that to blow my mind"
- Oracle: "How about a charge blast to the head?  That ought to blow your mind."

- Oracle: "Well, why would you want to save the planet?"
- Wally: "Because I'm one of the idiots who live here?  A lot of good people call this place home!"
- Wally: "And considering neither of us know where you're from, that includes you too!"
- Oracle: "Ha ha, sounds reasonable.  Favors or compensation from all these 'good people' once this is all over sounds reasonable too, no?"
- Wally: "Heh, sure.  But try to take this more seriously."


========================================

Character-building conversations:

Wally's education:
	...
	- Wally: I taught you some of what I know about the world, but not all.  So *logically* that means all the knowledge you know is a subset of the knowledge I know.
	- Wally: And *that*, ha-HA!  ...proves I'm smarter.  Don't feel bad, I'll have you know I skipped a grade in high school.
	- Oracle: That is a flawed argument and you know it.  You assume I do not learn on my own.
	- Wally: Uh, likewise.
	- ...
	- Wally: Tried it once, didn't like it.
	- Wally: I experiment and do research on my own because it makes me feel good.
	- Wally: At a university, everyone acts like they've got something to prove, and they expected me to do the same.  There's no genuine pursuit of discovery, just the pursuit 
	

Wally and his father:
	- Wally: 

=========================================

Wally Advice: General (just after world end revelation):
	- Wally: The decryptor abilities should be your biggest priority right now.  These abilities will aid you with exploration, and any information we can get about the world map will be useful.
	- Wally: Don't feel like you have to plan the entire final world-saving route just yet.  Hold off until you know more about the world map, and at the very least wait until we know where all the ____ are.

Wally Advice: Time Tree (1):
	- Wally: The time tree keeps track of all the different paths through the world you foresee yourself taking.
	- Wally: Each node of the tree shows the time you arrived at the chamber, as well as the physical upgrades you accumulated at that point.
	- Wally: Branches are added to the tree by visiting chambers.
	- Wally: (show example using the map) For example: at t=-50 you were at chamber A3, and then you foresaw yourself arriving at chamber B4 at t=-40.  This is shown by this branch connecting A3 to B4.
	- Wally: However, this other time you decided to visit C2 instead, at t=-35.  This is shown by this branch connecting A3 to C2.
	- Wally: Every time you visit a chamber, a branch is added connecting it to the chamber you were at previously.
	- Wally: There's one exception to this, however.  If you visit the same chamber without acquiring a new physical upgrade, no progress has been made.  In that case, no branch is made, as it would be redundant.

Wally Advice: Time Tree (2):
	- Wally: One way to use the time tree is to simulate "fast travel".
	- Wally: (show example using map) Say you want to visit chamber A3, or somewhere near A3.  You can try walking all the way over there, using up precious time.
	- Wally: However, you've visited chamber A3 at some point.  So instead you can preform a Chamber Flashback to when you visited A3.
	- Wally: To you it'll appear like you went back to A3 instantly.
	- Wally: And since you visited A3 in the past, rather than in the future, you get the added bonus of having more time to explore before the world ends.
	- Wally: Always remember: information you've acquired, like decryptor abilities and map data, is conserved when performing a Chamber Flashback.  But you'll lose any physical upgrades, like health, you accumulated after you left A3.

Wally Advice: Time Tree (3):
	- Wally: As you know, new branches are added by visiting Chambers, and only by visiting chambers.
	- Wally: Thus it is impossible to "merge" branches, in case you were wondering.  It's a Time TREE, after all.
	- Wally: For organization, you may want to delete branches you don't want to use anymore.  This can only be done through the Time Tree menu.
	- Wally: However, removing a Chamber node will also remove all the branches connected to the right of it.  Be be very careful when deleting nodes.

Wally Advice: Booster Upgrade:
	- Wally: Hey, you found the Booster upgrade!  That's awesome!
	- Wally: This is a very powerful physical upgrade.  It's needed to use several decryptor abilities, including one that lets you move super fast.
	- Wally: But since it's a physical upgrade, you can't use it at a time before you acquired it.
	- Wally: Clearly it would be best to acquire this upgrade as soon as possible during the final world-saving route.
	- Wally: When you're feeling up to it, I recommend doing a Chamber Flashback to the very beginning and making a beeline for the booster upgrade.  The earlier you've acquired it, the easier the rest of your run will become. 

=========================================

Conversation about something exploding halfway before world ends.

Conversation about no enemies showing up 5 minutes before world ends.
	- Wally: "Things seem to have simmered down."
	- Oracle: "Yes... I am not getting attacked anymore."
	- Wally: "Well I won't take a reprieve for granted, but this feels, uh, wrong.  Enemies were all ready to attack you head on a minute ago, and now they're not even showing up?  That's an abrupt change of heart."
	- Oracle: "I can faintly hear them.  Those creatures are still around.  But they appear to be... hiding."
	- Wally: "Hiding?  Oh, I think I get it."
	- Wally: "After slaughtering their friends and family, those green beach balls finally realized that showing their faces around a walking metal death machine was, shocker, a bad idea!"
	- Oracle: "..."
	- Wally: "It's a joke."
	- Oracle: "... haha."

"I have to kill fast but bullets too slow."
=========================================

It's not revealed Sonata's mouth is shut until later?  End of the demo?

	
Story arcs take place on different paths to different parts of the map.
	

Gimmicks to "Vision" mechanic that actually make sense:
- Quantum attacks:
	- Multiple visions of an attack going in different directions, and a direction is randomly chosen when the attack is actually made.
	- When reverting back before the attack is made, the direction chosen may be different.
- Virus hallucinations:
	- Vaguely described as hallucinations or viruses in Oracle's computer-like brain.
	- Oracle gets stuck in a vision, and cannot revert back while a virus is present.
	- Oracle in "present time" appears to be paralyzed.
		- "Present time" referring to when she gets a vision of the viruses.
	- When the virus(es) in an encounter are defeated, Oracle automatically reverts back to "present time".
	- After the virus(es) are dealt with, "present time" Oracle is no longer paralyzed, and seems to have just envisioned all of those events.
		- However, these events do not happen.  Viruses will only appear on "false timelines".  This is asserted by Oracle always reverting to "present time" before the viruses appear.
	- 100% reality: Oracle being temporarily paralyzed.
		- This happens, can be predicted, will always happen at the same time, etc.
- Secret creepy stuff
	- Enter a room, something unnerving happens, then automatically flashes back to the beginning of the room.
		- Similar to sanity effects from Eternal Darkness.
	- When doing a flashback during a conversation, some of the words on screen will change briefly.
		- When a letter disappears (reverse of appearing), another letter will remain behind it.
	- Hide a graphic (camera?  smile?) in the background of every room.
	- "Out of bounds" rooms, don't get drawn to the map.
		- Time freezes here
		- Find hidden stuff.
- The Salesman
	- Reference to the classic NP-Hard Traveling Salesman problem.
	- Looks like a salamander that walks upright.  Wears a trenchcoat similar to the merchant from RE4, tries too hard too look cool.
	- Someone else is moving around the world, visiting specific areas at specific time intervals.
	- Can meet at certain points during the adventure.  Sells special phase crystals that permanently increase your phase meter in exchange for a health upgrade.
		- In UI, a health upgrade traded for a crystal is represented by drawing a crystal over where the heart would be.
		- The trades affect Salesman's own abilities for the bossfight later.

===========
Defeating Oracle's virus:

- After the boss battle, virus isn't dead at all, and Oracle's health drops to "0" (Oracle isn't dead yet, but very close)
	- Cinematics: screen is being scratchy and almost fading to black, the death tree keeps appearing and disappearing.
- But in the nick of time, Oracle's suit explodes, but Oracle is fine in her larva form.
- Wally figured out that the suit had a virus causing Oracle to hallucinate.  He didn't know how to stop it, but he was able to quickly write a program that can strip Oracle's suit remotely.  Without the suit, Oracle no longer receives hallucinations.
- After exploring, Oracle comes across a similar suit and jumps into it.  Wally detects the suit's code is functioning properly, with no viruses.  Aside from the virus, the firmwares are identical.
- Wally uses a special program to "take the difference" between the two firmwares, which leaves behind only the virus.  Now isolated, Wally easily constructs a decryptor that quarantines the virus, and sends it to Oracle.
- Now Oracle will never have viruses for the rest of the game, in any suit.

===========
The Salesman is evil reveal:

- At first, The Salesman is introduced as a suave version of the Merchant from RE4.
	- Sells permanent phase upgrades in exchange for permanent health upgrades.
	- Gives Oracle a "card" of him (is one of those collectible cards) that explains where he'll be at what time.
	- Speaks mysterious lines, seems to know what's coming.  Knows Oracle's name and ability.
	- Mentions he can't sell upgrades to Oracle, since he fights with needles (BAD IDEA; too obvious).
	- Wally asks to call him "Sale-mander".  He declines.
	- The Salesman has a bad memory too
		- "What's your real name?" "Actually... I don't know.  But you're the first one I've met that cared about it more than me."
		- Foreshadows not only his future sensing powers (and consequences), but also that he's lived with them longer than Oracle.  Oracle has a bad memory, but she still knows her own name.
- Sonata's death speech:
	- She's the most powerful creature on the island, has the ability to control the will of anyone that listens to her voice.
		- The effect still lasts even after being silenced.
		- Oracle recalls this effect doesn't last forever.  A few minutes before The Meltdown, all the creatures on the island started hiding after being freed from Sonata.
			- Shown in-game by enemies not appearing starting a few minutes before The Meltdown.
	- Wally says Sonata isn't as powerful as she thinks.  Even before falling to Oracle, her mouth was stitched shut against her will.
	- Sonata was knocked out by somebody, and her mouth was stitched together by the time she came to.
	- Following conversation between Oracle and Wally foreshadows The Salesman.
		- Wally: "Sonata was subdued, but not killed.  That makes it hard to say if this attacker was an enemy or not."
		- Wally: "Who or what even has the ability to do this?  A whacked-out surgeon?"
		- Oracle: "Or somebody good with needles..."
		- Wally: "Hmm, do we know anybody around here that's really good at knitting?"
- Reveal happens after Oracle's virus is defeated.
	- 

==========================================
During Oracle's final search to collect all the orbs, she's visited by The Salesman one last time.
- The Salesman knows she's able to defeat him, so isn't looking for a conflict.
- 4th wall breaking: Player is in a hurry to collect the orbs before The Meltdown, so The Salesman brings up the pause menu to continue the conversation (time is stopped when talking in the pause menu, but continues when talking in-game).
- Just warns Oracle that collecting the orbs is a bad idea.


Ending ideas:

- Tom tasked The Salesman with causing The Meltdown.  "Selling the world"
	- In exchange, The Salesman was given a detailed map of the island.  The map contained key locations of very valuable phase crystals, which were free for The Salesman to take and sell as he wished.
		- Oracle can optionally find this map later on.  While the crystals obviously aren't there any more, the map still lays out most of the land.  Finding the map fills in your own map a lot (but doesn't include many secret areas).
	- The crystals were guaranteed to be there because the island is too dangerous for anyone else to visit.  The brainwashed creatures and Sonata herself were enough to prevent tourists.
	- But this was no problem for The Salesman with his vision abilities.  The first thing he did on the island was subduing Sonata by stitching her mouth shut.
	- The Salesman infiltrated the base of operations for the internal planetary shield, and sabotaged it.
		- ***NOTE*** for this to work, the planetary shield must have been installed here before Sonata gained control of the island's creatures.
	- Tom also asked The Salesman to collect the 4 orbs and give them to him, but The Salesman knew that if he did, Tom would have the ability to time travel.
	- Orbs in reality aren't needed to fix the internal shield, they're needed to create a beacon to the center of the planet, where the singularity required for time travel will be made.  Tom hoped The Salesman would collect the orbs for him in order to do this.

- Main villain behind everything is Tom, who is Wally's dad (and only other human in the game)
	- Wally is here too, in the same room as Oracle and Tom.
	- How did he get there?  Kidnapped at some point?
	- Needs to provide more personal argument.
- Wanted to use the tremendous energy from The Meltdown in order to power a time machine.
	- Needs to fix a problem
	- ?? WHAT PROBLEM ??
- Despite Oracle's wishes, Wally starts to side with Tom at the end because he trusts his dad's intentions
	- With the time machine, Tom will be able to go back to before The Meltdown ever happened, and fix it.
	- Oracle reasons that this plan doesn't work, because The Meltdown is still happening.
	- Wally rebuttals that Oracle was destined to kill Tom before the time machine can be used, and she needs to let Tom live in order to use the time machine to change history.
	- Wally notes that Oracle told him about he was willing to die to let Oracle survive The Meltdown in another vision (which led to Oracle killing The Salesman and figuring out how to obtain the 4th key/orb).  Now it's Oracle's turn to make a sacrifice by trusting Wally.
- After being defeated, Tom specifically mentions the problem ??? he was trying to solve.
	- Oracle suddenly gets very interested in how he intended to solve the problem.
	- She even kills Wally in front of Tom for extra motivation.
	- After Tom explains his solution, Oracle shoots him anyway for her own amusement.
	- Oracle starts laughing suspiciously, implies she might be going down the same route as The Salesman.
		- Also implied by the "There can be only one" line she says after killing The Salesman.
- Game ends right here, roll credits.  Big WTF moment.
	- Appears to completely betray the game's theme of trust at the last moment.  But is not actually the case.
	- Secret text in dialogue between Wally and Oracle reveal that deep down they still trusted each other.
- But if high completion percentage, bonus cutscene explains this.
	- Oracle then reverts way back to before the game even started, and fixes the problem.  Tells Grygor the solution?
	- Oracle is with Grygor here, as a larva in an early half-complete version of her suit.  Hasn't been sent to Wally yet.
	- Different, more realistic visual style here?  Shows this is real, not a vision, and that everything else that happened in the game was a vision until this point.
	
The "problem":
- Putting a shield around the planet's core was plan B.  This was plan A:
- Dig a hole into the planet and drop gigantic phase crystals embedded in some room down it.  Their presence will cool down the core and stop the combustions.
- This plan was thought to not work because they didn't think the crystals were big or potent enough.  It was also dangerous to dig a hole into the planet when it's on the verge of exploding.
- But further research (led by Tom) suggested that the crystals were actually much more powerful than previously thought.  So plan A would indeed work.
- It was too late though.  By the time Tom determined plan A could work, plan B had already been completed with the shield across the mantle.
- Oracle learns this from Tom at the end of the game, then reverts to before the beginning to tell Grygor.  He then gets plan A approved, so the crystals are dumped into the mantle, calming the core and saving the planet.
- Grygor has heard of Tom, but Tom kept his work a secret.
- Controversial for Oracle (and The Salesman) since these important crystals are also tied to their future sensing abilities.  When they're destroyed they won't be able to sense the future anymore.
- Tom was doing research on the gigantic crystals as he was building his time machine.  Although he ended up using the planet's core as a power source instead, this explains why he knows about them and was able to explain it to Oracle.

Phase Crystals and Oracle/The Salesman:
- Represent "focus", which allows them to concentrate hard enough to predict the future.


==========================================

World-building:

- World populated with animals and creatures.  Many creatures wield weapons.
- Wally is the only human creature in the game.
- Arctic setting.
- Mantle within the world is dangerously unstable, is in danger of bursting through the ground.
	- Was artificially sealed with a barrier.
	- Side affect of the sealing was making the world much colder.

World ending moment:
- The seal around the mantle is broken.
- Volcanoes sprout out of nowhere, spewing lava onto the ground and ash into the atmosphere.
- Everything on the surface burns to death.  Everything in the air beneath the clouds suffocates from the noxious gases in the atmosphere.
- One safe spot: Mount Apogee, a mountain whose peak rests above the clouds.
	- Player and other characters can survive the apocalypse by being on Mount Apogee when the barrier breaks.
- Most of the peak of Mount Apogee can't be explored until The Meltdown happens.  There is a giant ice pillar blocking entrance that can't be destroyed, but it melts once The Meltdown happens.

Quantum Attacks Guy Backstory:
- A brilliant scientist (creature)
	- Explains how he knows what quantum attacks are.
- He heard about ____ secret plot being planned by Wally's dad.
- He was the one that sent Wally larva Oracle, then her suit, then the saucer, then the instructions to stop the world-ending meltdown.
- But soon after he did this, he was visited by Sonata and brainwashed.

Sonata Backstory:
- Mouth sowed up by The Salesman.
- Cuts her mouth open to enable her to attack when fighting Oracle.
	- Brainwash effects end a duration after Sonata was silenced.
	- For the last 5 minutes before the world ends, the enemies are no longer brainwashed, so no enemies attack Oracle.
		- Enemies don't spawn, "they're hiding"
	- Can also talk to Quantum Attacks guy during this duration.

The Salesman Backstory: (BAD IDEA to flesh out backstory?  Leave ambiguous?)
- Can sense the future, same as Oracle.
	- Same species as Oracle?  Related?
- In conversations Wally has with Oracle, they note that Oracle could theoretically do whatever she wanted without negative repercussions.  He notes that Oracle might halfway be there already, with how desensitized she is to killing enemies.  Oracle is bothered by this a little.  "Me acting only for myself... does not lead to a pleasant future."
BAD IDEA: Fleshing out backstory:
	- Was terrified of all the visions he saw as a kid.  Knew the end of the world was inevitable, didn't know how to stop it.
	- Changed since childhood, decided to accept the world's fate and make the best of it.
	- He would always change the way he acted to how he anticipated conversations with others, and got frustrated when they wouldn't do the same.  Decided not to care about others.
BETTER IDEA: Unknown backstroy and motivations:
	- As with Oracle, The Salesman's clairvoyance results in him suffering from a poor memory.
	- Even he doesn't know what there is to be gained or lost from destroying the world.
	- But it was a plan he created long ago, and he trusts his own past self to know what to expect.
- Would sell and trade things to improve his own life, would sucker other people out.
- "Sold the fate of the world"


Final Boss Backstory:
- Wants to blow up the planet to get enough energy to use true time travel
- 

Oracle Backstory:
- Suit originally created for Oracle to become a weapon?

Credits Epilogue:
(Happens after massive revert to the true present, where larva oracle tells Grygor about using the gigantic phase crystals in Plan A to prevent the planet's destruction instead of building the inner planetary shield in Plan B)
- Oracle and Wally go to the island just as Sonata initially arrived.
- Before becoming empress, Sonata was a scared child that just wanted friends.  She was going to use her vocal brainwashing powers to convince the creatures to hang with her.
	- But before long, Sonata would begin to abuse her immense power, and become corrupted by it.  This is how she became an evil empress by the time the game starts.
- Oracle explains all this to Sonata, who is unsure of what to do.
- The Salesman is here too, as a good guy.  Because why not.
	- Implied Oracle previously found and talked to The Salesman in a way similar to Sonata.


BAD IDEAS:
- Events being different than how they were envisioned
	- Because that in itself is a vision, which is the same as envisioned.
	
The planet's core is unstable and threatened to cause the planet to crack, so a long time ago scientists created a gigantic internal shield to stabilize it.  The shield is on the verge of breaking, and Oracle (the Cyborg) needs to find a way to fix it.  The shield's existence also explains the cold climate.

If the shield breaks, it would result in a huge explosion.  The big villain is planning on using the energy from the explosion to create a time machine for his own use.

The creatures are all hostile due to them all being brainwashed by the villain.

STREAMLINING THE STORY:
- Little dialogue.  Keep story interesting with lore and secret history stuff.

- Remove NPC.  Oracle was found and raised by Wally.
	- Oracle found in suit already.  Wally studies the suit, but doesn't know much about it (essential so that he cannot unlock abilities, and decryptors are needed)
		- Later in the game, Wally is able to create the Strip Suit decrytor to save Oracle just in time in her fight against the virus boss.
- Oracle's vision about The Meltdown is shown in the game intro.
	- Happens right after Wally announces he's finished making the ship.
		- So it's possible that Oracle knew about The Meltdown for a while, and just waited until the last minute to tell him to not stress him out.  It wouldn't matter, since they wouldn't be able to do anything about it until the ship was made anyway.
	- Oracle foresaw them telling others about The Meltdown, but nobody would believe her.  It's "common knowledge" that the shield is infallible.
- Wally stays inside the ship while Oracle explores Seudar Isle.  He'll research The Meltdown, explain the Endoplanetary Shield, etc.
	- Conversations about history and lore will be periodically added to the Talk Page from Wally.
- Shield was built to last millennia, no reason why it should be malfunctioning.
	- Eventually revealed that The Salesman sabotaged it as part of a deal with Christopher.
- Sonata conquered the island while 
- A lot of technology and machinery still exist on Seudar Isle, left over from when the shield was built.
	- Explains why some of the creatures use items as weapons.
	- Fights would break out among the creatures and the scraps were fashioned into weapons.  The island became infamous for being dangerous.
- All the fighting stopped when Sonata conquered the island.  She simply used her voice to hypnotize all the creatures, preventing them from harming each other.
	- Created peace, but Sonata would eventually abuse her power.  She forced some creatures to do her bidding, and commanded creatures to attack anyone that could pose a threat.
- Nobody on the island believes The Meltdown is coming either.
- Wally's motivation to save the planet is to save his father.  He left home while Wally was young, but he's still on the planet, so he wants to save him.
	- Wally reasons that as one of the world's leading scientists he would have had enough money to travel to another planet.  But after he was demoted he would not be able to.
		- Turns out his father just built his own ship.  Wally didn't think of that.
- Wally's father (Christopher) was a scientist, but he was humiliated by having a crazy theory
	- Theory was dumping giant phase crystals into the mantle to calm it down for good, preventing The Meltdown forever.
		- Community thought the idea was ridiculous.  It wasn't known if the crystals were potent enough to calm down the entire mantle.  Since the plan involved drilling a giant hole into the violent mantle, there was potential to make the problem even worse, so it was too great a risk.
	- Left scientific community, left home so that he could "have some space to think".
- It's revealed that after Christopher left, he tried to make a time machine.  This would be able to fix everything.  The endoplanetary shield was a temporary solution; with the time machine, he could go back to before the shield was built, dump the giant phase crystals into the mantle, calming it down for good.
	- But it would require an immense amount of energy, called a singularity, to work.  Triggering The Meltdown was the only way he could produce this amount of energy.
	- He hired The Salesman to sabotage the Endoplanetary Shield.  He was the only one psychotic enough to destroy the planet, yet powerful enough to subdue Sonata and Seudar Isle's creatures.
		- In return, he gave The Salesman a map with the locations of many rare phase crystals that he could take.
			- Christopher had a map from when he was studying phase crystals for his theory to stop The Meltdown.
			- Did not give the location of the biggest phase crystals, so The Salesman never found them.  Christopher doesn't trust him.
- An advanced civilization from a thousand years ago built the Endoplanetary Shield.  
- IDEAS: Have the main villain be a lone descendant from this civilization.  Wants to create a time machine to go back home.
	- This villain, Oracle and The Salesman are all from the past.  They were frozen in ice, floated to the top of ocean, washed ashore elsewhere.  Found Oracle and her suit on the beach.
	- Since clairvoyance makes it hard to remember the past, Oracle and The Salesman have no memory of the civilization.
- IDEAS NEED TO BE REWORKED: What does any of this have to do with The Meltdown?
	- Oracle and The Salesman were actually enemies of the civilization.  They were trying to steal their giant phase crystals.
	- This villain stopped them a thousand years ago by creating a virus that game Oracle and The Salesman false visions, giving him a chance to strike with a powerful ice attacked that froze all of them.
	- The weapons and materials used in their fight against Oracle and The Salesman became the weapons used by creatures many years later.
	- Explains why this villain knows of Oracle's and The Salesman's power (and asks TS to help), yet doesn't trust them.
	- Lore can be told through drawings on walls?
	- Sherivice and Sonata are descendants of this villain and the actual empress of the civilization.
- Oracle's suit is one of many that were used on Seudar Isle long ago.  They belonged to the advanced civilization.
	- But in the battle a thousand years ago, Oracle was equipped with a much larger suit called Vidici Shell.
	- All told in futuristic hieroglyphs and pictures on the wall.
- Vidici:
	- Giant mech that Oracle and The Salesman piloted to 
- New opening:
	- Oracle and Wally receive a package containing a mysterious rock reminiscent of a large phase crystal.
	- This interests Oracle.  She wants to learn more about it, and claims it may help her learn more about her past.
		- Actually, Oracle has a drug-like obsession with phase crystals.
	- Wally says that phase crystals only come from Seudar Isle, and concludes the going there would be the best way to learn more about it.
	- Rock was embedded with a device that secretly gave Oracle a virus.
		- She unknowingly gets infected when she touches the rock in a cutscene.
t-W: This rock we received just looks like a large phase crystal to me.  I'm surprised you're so interested in it.
t-O: |Phase crystals| help me focus... they give my mind clarity.
// Move to touch rock
t-O: But the feeling I get from this surpasses that of any crystal I have encountered before.
t-O: An empowering sensation reverberates through my entire body... absolutely incredible...
// release grip from walk, start walking away
t-W: I'm more interested in why it just randomly showed up on my doorstep the other--
t-W: Hey, where're you going?
t-O: A creature is about to attack us.  I am going to go deal with it.
t-W: Huh?  Attacked?  I... I don't think I equipped this ship with anything--
t-O: Do not worry, this will not take long once I |get to the roof of the ship|.

t-O: Give up, Sherivice.  You lose this fight.
t-Sherivice: Halt!  I'm Sherivice, and you are trespassing on-- hey, how did you know my name?
t-O: I knew your name a few seconds ago because you just said it now.  I can foresee the future.
t-Sherivice: Can you now?  Then you should know what happens to those that pick fights with me!

t-O: Problem averted Wally.  Sherivice will not bother us while unconscious on the ground below.
t-W: Ah... good to hear.
// fade to black (show splash image of giant rock?)
t-W: Anyway, this giant rock just appeared next to our house yesterday.  I'm as interested in it as you.
t-W: If it's a large phase crystal as you claim, then there's no doubt it came from |Seudar Isle|,
t-W: the island we're flying towards.  If there are answers to be found, we'll find them here.
t-O: I... I hope so.

// Cloudy Future
t-O: One thing has been bothering me Wally.
t-W: What is that?
t-O: Past 30 or so minutes my visions start to become... cloudy.  The situations I run into and
t-O: the actions I take in response all feel uncertain.  My visions feel incomplete and full of holes
t-O: I cannot tell if what I see is the truth, or something my mind instinctively creates to 'fill in' the gaps.
t-W: Well it's normal for memories to become weaker over time for humans.  Do you think it's like that?
t-O: No.  Usually my visions are perfectly accurate no matter the span of time.  This is different.
t-W: Alright... maybe you're sick?  Feeling under the weather?
t-O: What?
t-W: Just spit-balling ideas here.  Sorry I'm not being especially helpful.  Again.
t-W: Hey, is this why you can't see yourself finding the origin of the giant phase crystal?
t-O: Well I kind of perceive something... possibly?  I cannot say for sure...
t-W: I think it just means your mortal like the rest of us.  I wouldn't stress over it Oracle.

Motivation to go to the island:
- Find the second half to a giant phase crystal that Wally has.  It's on Seudar Isle.
- At the beginning, Oracle confirms she already knows where it is and what she does to get it.  But Wally refuses to let Oracle tell him to keep it a surprise.
