* Basic jumping and shooting controls.

* Fight enemies, acquire phase pickup.

** Vision ability is introduced. (Phase meter does not decrease over time)

* Phase crystals are introduced.
	- Shooting a phase crystal will cause a phase pickup to fly out.

* Fight enemies, max out phase meter.

* Chamber Save.

* Encounter large door that obviously requires password to unlock (e.g. stepping on tiles in a certain order)
	- Gamedev cheating: make this impossible to guess until going into the room with the password.

* Find health upgrade (is a physical upgrade, so will be lost when reverting before a time it was acquired)
	- Technically optional, but very hard to miss.

** Flashback ability introduced.
	- There is a truss bridge over a vat of quicksand.
		- Quicksand drags victims towards the middle, then down under to kill them.
		- Can't move or jump in quicksand, but can shoot.
	- Mines have been placed all over the bridge.  Walking into one will cause the bridge to collapse, dropping Oracle into the quicksand.
	- Need to use Flashback ability to revert back to before the mine was set off.
		- Need to "cheat" and make sure player has enough phase at this point.
		- Reward a lot of phase to player in fight immediately before this, and give the player enough phase if they're really stupid before then.
		- NO Phase Crystals nearby.  This wouldn't help.
	- To solve puzzle: shoot boulders on the side in a way that Oracle can climb to the top of the truss bridge and walk over the mines.

* Find decryptor upgrade (is information that unlocks one of Oracle's innate abilities, so it not lost when reverting)
	- Something obvious but really easy to grasp, e.g. charge shot.
	- Upgrade is mandatory to get to the next room.

** Chamber Flashback ability introduced.
	- Find password for the large door on the wall.
	- Tutorial screen pops up acknowledging it's obvious what to do next, suggests Chamber Flashback in order to get back to the door quickly.
	- Shortcuts (shown as prompts during flashbacks):
		- FLASHBACK + DODGE to automatically revert to the last Chamber/save point.
		- FLASHBACK + START to open up the Time Tree in the pause menu and select from there.

* Unlock door by inputting the password.
	- Wally is surprised she knows it, Oracle explains she had a vision of finding the room with the password.
	- Password: fruit related.  Make it a theme?  Match Toucade?

* Simple puzzle involving charge shot.
	- Wally surprised again.  Oracle explains decryptor code.
	- Wally reiterates that information is saved when doing a flashback.
	- If Oracle picked up the health upgrade but forgot to get it again after the chamber flashback, she will explain her vision and acknowledge that her health didn't increase.
	- Wally reiterates that physical upgrades are not saved when doing a flashback.  (But you can go back and get them again)
	- Wally mentions he's going to stop getting surprised when Oracle does something she's never done before.

	- Can be used to get a bit more height/distance.

...

** Grenade decryptor (Hold direction and press X/Triangle to throw)

...
	
* Grenade distance decryptor (tap direction before pressing to throw the grenade a greater distance) (optional)

...

* Dodge slide decryptor (maintain momentum when using the dodge ability at an angle towards the ground) (optional)

...

** Double jump (requires booster)

...

*** Strip suit (reduces Oracle to her larval form, allowing her to travel through tight corridors)

===========================================

At ____ hours/minutes in, gameplay is spontaneously interrupted with a cutscene of the world blowing up.  Neither Oracle nor Wally expect this to happen so soon.

- Next scene is back at the start of the game, with Oracle being shocked.
- Explains that world ends at exactly ____ time, and that they don't know if it's even possible to collect all the ____ in time.
- Wally just received the saucer, so he couldn't get here any earlier.
- Oracle admits she lied and doesn't actually know the outcome of the mission.  Something is "blocking" Oracle from seeing further.
	- Foreshadowing: Oracle falls asleep just before landing the finishing blow on the final boss.
- Oracle shares everything she (and the player) found out about the map.
(time map is shown on screen)
- Wally notes that Oracle seemed to spend a long time going from (current/first area) to (early area with the first ____), even though they're not far from each other.
- Wally suggests that Oracle (the player) use her new abilities to find a shortcut to the early area.  That will give her more time to collect all the ___.
	- Wally: Try exploring this area close by.  Your new abilities might let you get through.
- There is a mandatory decryptor on the path there.

===========================================

Important early conversations to close plot-holes:

- Oracle waiting for others to finish speaking:
	- Wally: I was wondering, if you know everything I'm about to say--
	- Oracle: --why do I not finish your sentences?
	- Wally: ... yes.
	- Oracle: Well clearly I am able to do so.  You are curious as to why I wait for you to finish before speaking?"
	- Wally: Well if you know what I'm going to tell you--
	- Oracle: --then why say anything at all?
	- Wally: ... then... s-stop that!
	- Oracle: Heh heh.  You now have your answer.  You understandably do not appreciate getting interrupted.  Forming a hostile relationship between us is not advantageous for either of us, so I prefer we converse like ordinary humans.
	- Wally: Good point.  But how cool would it be if you acknowledge everything I'm about to say before I take the time to let the words come out?  Conversation would be so efficient!
	- Oracle: I am not a mind reader Wally.  I will not understand you if you do not actually speak anything.
	- Wally: That is true.

- Wally and Oracle not arriving earlier if it's eventually revealed that there's huge time pressure:
	- Wally: A functional saucer spontaneously appearing on my doorstep just yesterday?  No that part is true.  It's probably from the same "stork" that sent you and your suit.
	- Oracle: You did not build the suit and you did not build the saucer.  And you clearly only have a child's grasp on how any of them work.  Wally is there anything you *can* do?
	- Wally: I told you.  I tinker.  I modify, take part, and learn.  Actually constructing large projects are for no-life mega nerds with oodles of grant money.  And I don't have any grant money.

- Other early conversation:
	- Wally: ...
	- Oracle: I am not easily surprised.

- Other early conversation:
	- Wally: So Oracle... do we win?  We make it out alive after defeating the bad guys and stuff right?
	- Oracle: Of course!

- Isn't Oracle doing everything?
	- Wally: Well, my combat abilities aren't as good as yours Oracle.  Erm, it would be best for me to just stay here in the saucer where it's warm.  And provide, you know, support.
	- Oracle: That seems like the best way to maximize your usefulness.
	- Wally: Do I detect sarcasm?  You think I won't be that much of a help stuck here huh?
	- Oracle: That is an odd way to interpret what I said.  But I do not disagree.
	- Wally: If you know everything that will happen there's not a lot to help out with.
	- Oracle: An extra brain to process information cannot be unhelpful.  I urge you to remain here.
	- Oracle: Additionally if you leave now you do not, uh, stay together.
	- Wally: Oh... thank you.  Hey, at least we can keep each other from getting bored.  No matter how prepared you must be, it'll be better if you're less lonely right!
	- Oracle: I appreciate the company Wally.

- What happens to the "current timeline" when Oracle does a flashback?
	- Wally: Hmm, you seem to be in a tight spot.  Do you see a way out?
	- Oracle: No I do not.
	- Wally: What happens now?  Do we just stay here forever?  Until the world ends?
	- Oracle: ...
	- Wally: Our chance at a happy ending, all gone because of some stupid mistake?  No blaze of glory, we can't even really say we tried our best!  Oracle is there really no way back?
	- Oracle: ... well...
	- Wally: Oh hell no, please don't pull that time travel vision crap here.  I know how it works, you've told me enough times.  But when you do a flashback you're leaving the rest of the world in the dust!
	- Oracle: Wally--
	- Wally: Yes, your body stays here, whatever.  You're not going back to the past, but at the same time, *you* are retreating back to a time when the world isn't screwed over.
	- Oracle: Wally.  If it makes you feel better, none of this is actually happening.  This entire universe at this moment is just an illusion, a figment of how I perceive the world to be.
	- Wally: ...
	- Oracle: Meaning you are not real.
	- Wally: That doesn't make me feel better at all!
	- Oracle: I know.
	- Wally: So now what?  I spend my last remaining moments alive knowing nothing was worth it because I don't even exist?
	- Oracle: ... yeah?
	- Wally: ...
	- Oracle: You should not think about it too hard.

Opening conversation; Oracle spoiling the game?  BETTER IDEA: Have this conversation later, once it's been well established that Oracle can see the future.
- Oracle boasts that she already knows she'll complete the mission and beat the bad guys.  Offers to let Wally know how it happens.
- Wally hesitates.  Confirming how Oracle saves the world would put his worries at ease, but it would ruin the excitement of experiencing it for himself.
- Player now gets to choose to keep it a secret or to reveal everything to Wally (thus spoiling the game for the player).
	- If chooses yes, Oracle explains everything she think will happen (defeating Grygor, Grygor actually being Mr. X, defeating Sonata, 4 orbs, fixing the shield, etc.).
	- However, Oracle does not mention anything involving her glitches (the world being blown up early, glitch bosses, The Salesman, etc.), because she doesn't know about them yet.
	- Wally will be annoyed, and will remember this choice.

========================================

Character-building conversations:

Wally's education:
	...
	- Wally: I taught you some of what I know about the world, but not all.  So *logically* that means all the knowledge you know is a subset of the knowledge I know.
	- Wally: And *that*, ha-HA!  ...proves I'm smarter.  Don't feel bad, I'll have you know I skipped a grade in high school.
	- Oracle: That is a flawed argument and you know it.  You assume I do not learn on my own.
	- Wally: Uh, likewise.
	- ...
	- Wally: Tried it once, didn't like it.
	- Wally: I experiment and do research on my own because it makes me feel good.
	- Wally: At a university, everyone acts like they've got something to prove, and they expected me to do the same.  There's no genuine pursuit of discovery, just the pursuit 
	

Wally and his father:
	- Wally: 

=========================================

Wally Advice: General (just after world end revelation):
	- Wally: The decryptor abilities should be your biggest priority right now.  These abilities will aid you with exploration, and any information we can get about the world map will be useful.
	- Wally: Don't feel like you have to plan the entire final world-saving route just yet.  Hold off until you know more about the world map, and at the very least wait until we know where all the ____ are.

Wally Advice: Time Tree (1):
	- Wally: The time tree keeps track of all the different paths through the world you foresee yourself taking.
	- Wally: Each node of the tree shows the time you arrived at the chamber, as well as the physical upgrades you accumulated at that point.
	- Wally: Branches are added to the tree by visiting chambers.
	- Wally: (show example using the map) For example: at t=-50 you were at chamber A3, and then you foresaw yourself arriving at chamber B4 at t=-40.  This is shown by this branch connecting A3 to B4.
	- Wally: However, this other time you decided to visit C2 instead, at t=-35.  This is shown by this branch connecting A3 to C2.
	- Wally: Every time you visit a chamber, a branch is added connecting it to the chamber you were at previously.
	- Wally: There's one exception to this, however.  If you visit the same chamber without acquiring a new physical upgrade, no progress has been made.  In that case, no branch is made, as it would be redundant.

Wally Advice: Time Tree (2):
	- Wally: One way to use the time tree is to simulate "fast travel".
	- Wally: (show example using map) Say you want to visit chamber A3, or somewhere near A3.  You can try walking all the way over there, using up precious time.
	- Wally: However, you've visited chamber A3 at some point.  So instead you can preform a Chamber Flashback to when you visited A3.
	- Wally: To you it'll appear like you went back to A3 instantly.
	- Wally: And since you visited A3 in the past, rather than in the future, you get the added bonus of having more time to explore before the world ends.
	- Wally: Always remember: information you've acquired, like decryptor abilities and map data, is conserved when performing a Chamber Flashback.  But you'll lose any physical upgrades, like health, you accumulated after you left A3.

Wally Advice: Time Tree (3):
	- Wally: As you know, new branches are added by visiting Chambers, and only by visiting chambers.
	- Wally: Thus it is impossible to "merge" branches, in case you were wondering.  It's a Time TREE, after all.
	- Wally: For organization, you may want to delete branches you don't want to use anymore.  This can only be done through the Time Tree menu.
	- Wally: However, removing a Chamber node will also remove all the branches connected to the right of it.  Be be very careful when deleting nodes.

Wally Advice: Booster Upgrade:
	- Wally: Hey, you found the Booster upgrade!  That's awesome!
	- Wally: This is a very powerful physical upgrade.  It's needed to use several decryptor abilities, including one that lets you move super fast.
	- Wally: But since it's a physical upgrade, you can't use it at a time before you acquired it.
	- Wally: Clearly it would be best to acquire this upgrade as soon as possible during the final world-saving route.
	- Wally: When you're feeling up to it, I recommend doing a Chamber Flashback to the very beginning and making a beeline for the booster upgrade.  The earlier you've acquired it, the easier the rest of your run will become. 

=========================================

Conversation about something exploding halfway before world ends.

Conversation about no enemies showing up 5 minutes before world ends.
	- Wally: "Things seem to have simmered down."
	- Oracle: "Yes... I am not getting attacked anymore."
	- Wally: "Well I won't take a reprieve for granted, but this feels, uh, wrong.  Enemies were all ready to attack you head on a minute ago, and now they're not even showing up?  That's an abrupt change of heart."
	- Oracle: "I can faintly hear them.  Those creatures are still around.  But they appear to be... hiding."
	- Wally: "Hiding?  Oh, I think I get it."
	- Wally: "After slaughtering their friends and family, those green beach balls finally realized that showing their faces around a walking metal death machine was, shocker, a bad idea!"
	- Oracle: "..."
	- Wally: "It's a joke."
	- Oracle: "... haha."

=========================================
	
Story arcs take place on different paths to different parts of the map.
	

Gimmicks to "Vision" mechanic that actually make sense:
- Quantum attacks:
	- Multiple visions of an attack going in different directions, and a direction is randomly chosen when the attack is actually made.
	- When reverting back before the attack is made, the direction chosen may be different.
- Virus hallucinations:
	- Vaguely described as hallucinations or viruses in Oracle's computer-like brain.
	- Oracle gets stuck in a vision, and cannot revert back while a virus is present.
	- Oracle in "present time" appears to be paralyzed.
		- "Present time" referring to when she gets a vision of the viruses.
	- When the virus(es) in an encounter are defeated, Oracle automatically reverts back to "present time".
	- After the virus(es) are dealt with, "present time" Oracle is no longer paralyzed, and seems to have just envisioned all of those events.
		- However, these events do not happen.  Viruses will only appear on "false timelines".  This is asserted by Oracle always reverting to "present time" before the viruses appear.
	- 100% reality: Oracle being temporarily paralyzed.
		- This happens, can be predicted, will always happen at the same time, etc.
- Secret creepy stuff
	- Enter a room, something unnerving happens, then automatically flashes back to the beginning of the room.
		- Similar to sanity effects from Eternal Darkness.
	- When doing a flashback during a conversation, some of the words on screen will change briefly.
		- When a letter disappears (reverse of appearing), another letter will remain behind it.
	- Hide a graphic (camera?  smile?) in the background of every room.
	- "Out of bounds" rooms, don't get drawn to the map.
		- Time freezes here
		- Find hidden stuff.
- The Salesman
	- Reference to the classic NP-Hard Traveling Salesman problem.
	- Someone else is moving around the world, visiting specific areas at specific time intervals.
	- Can meet at certain points during the adventure.  Sells special phase crystals that permanently increase your phase meter in exchange for a health upgrade.
		- In UI, a health upgrade traded for a crystal is represented by drawing a crystal over where the heart would be.
		- The trades affect Salesman's own abilities for the bossfight later.

==========================================
Ending ideas:

- Main villain behind everything is Tom, who is Wally's dad (and only other human in the game)
	- Wally is here too, in the same room as Oracle and Tom.
	- How did he get there?  Kidnapped at some point?
	- Needs to provide more personal argument.
- Wanted to use the tremendous energy from The Meltdown in order to power a time machine.
	- Needs to fix a problem
	- ?? WHAT PROBLEM ??
- Despite Oracle's wishes, Wally starts to side with Tom at the end because he trusts his dad's intentions
	- With the time machine, Tom will be able to go back to before The Meltdown ever happened, and fix it.
	- Oracle reasons that this plan doesn't work, because The Meltdown is still happening.
	- Wally rebuttals that Oracle was destined to kill Tom before the time machine can be used, and she needs to let Tom live in order to use the time machine to change history.
	- Wally notes that Oracle told him about he was willing to die to let Oracle survive The Meltdown in another vision (which led to Oracle killing The Salesman and figuring out how to obtain the 4th key/orb).  Now it's Oracle's turn to make a sacrifice by trusting Wally.
- After being defeated, Tom specifically mentions the problem ??? he was trying to solve.
	- Oracle suddenly gets very interested in how he intended to solve the problem.
	- She even kills Wally in front of Tom for extra motivation.
	- After Tom explains his solution, Oracle shoots him anyway for her own amusement.
	- Oracle starts laughing suspiciously, implies she might be going down the same route as The Salesman.
- Game ends right here, roll credits.  Big WTF moment.
- But if high completion percentage, bonus cutscene explains this.
	- Oracle then reverts way back to before the game even started, and fixes the problem.  Tells Grygor the solution?
	- Oracle is with Grygor here, as a larva in an early half-complete version of her suit.  Hasn't been sent to Wally yet.
	- Different, more realistic visual style here?  Shows this is real, not a vision, and that everything else that happened in the game was a vision until this point.
	
The "problem":
- Putting a shield around the planet's core was plan B.  This was plan A:
- Dig a hole into the planet and drop gigantic phase crystals embedded in some room down it.  Their presence will cool down the core and stop the combustions.
- This plan was thought to not work because they didn't think the crystals were big or potent enough.  It was also dangerous to dig a hole into the planet when it's on the verge of exploding.
- But further research (led by Tom) suggested that the crystals were actually much more powerful than previously thought.  So plan A would indeed work.
- It was too late though.  By the time Tom determined plan A could work, plan B had already been completed with the shield across the mantle.
- Oracle learns this from Tom at the end of the game, then reverts to before the beginning to tell Grygor.  He then gets plan A approved, so the crystals are dumped into the mantle, calming the core and saving the planet.
- Grygor has heard of Tom, but Tom kept his work a secret.
- Controversial for Oracle (and The Salesman) since these important crystals are also tied to their future sensing abilities.  When they're destroyed they won't be able to sense the future anymore.
- Tom was doing research on the gigantic crystals as he was building his time machine.  Although he ended up using the planet's core as a power source instead, this explains why he knows about them and was able to explain it to Oracle.

Phase Crystals and Oracle/The Salesman:
- Represent "focus", which allows them to concentrate hard enough to predict the future.


==========================================

World-building:

- World populated with animals and creatures.  Many creatures wield weapons.
- Wally is the only human creature in the game.
- Arctic setting.
- Mantle within the world is dangerously unstable, is in danger of bursting through the ground.
	- Was artificially sealed with a barrier.
	- Side affect of the sealing was making the world much colder.

World ending moment:
- The seal around the mantle is broken.
- Volcanoes sprout out of nowhere, spewing lava onto the ground and ash into the atmosphere.
- Everything on the surface burns to death.  Everything in the air beneath the clouds suffocates from the noxious gases in the atmosphere.
- One safe spot: Mount Apogee, a mountain whose peak rests above the clouds.
	- Player and other characters can survive the apocalypse by being on Mount Apogee when the barrier breaks.

Quantum Attacks Guy Backstory:
- A brilliant scientist (creature)
	- Explains how he knows what quantum attacks are.
- He heard about ____ secret plot being planned by Wally's dad.
- He was the one that sent Wally larva Oracle, then her suit, then the saucer, then the instructions to stop the world-ending meltdown.
- But soon after he did this, he was visited by Sonata and brainwashed.

Sonata Backstory:
- Mouth sowed up by The Salesman.
- Cuts her mouth open to enable her to attack when fighting Oracle.
	- Brainwash effects end a duration after Sonata was silenced.
	- For the last 5 minutes before the world ends, the enemies are no longer brainwashed, so no enemies attack Oracle.
		- Enemies don't spawn, "they're hiding"
	- Can also talk to Quantum Attacks guy during this duration.

The Salesman Backstory:
- Can sense the future, same as Oracle.
	- Same species as Oracle?  Related?
- In conversations Wally has with Oracle, they note that Oracle could theoretically do whatever she wanted without negative repercussions.  He notes that Oracle might halfway be there already, with how desensitized she is to killing enemies.  Oracle is bothered by this a little.  "Me acting only for myself... does not lead to a pleasant future."
- Was terrified of all the visions he saw as a kid.  Knew the end of the world was inevitable, didn't know how to stop it.
- Changed since childhood, decided to accept the world's fate and make the best of it.
- He would always change the way he acted to how he anticipated conversations with others, and got frustrated when they wouldn't do the same.  Decided not to care about others.
- Would sell and trade things to improve his own life, would sucker other people out.
- "Sold the fate of the world"

Final Boss Backstory:
- Wants to blow up the planet to get enough energy to use true time travel
- 

Oracle Backstory:
- Suit originally created for Oracle to become a weapon?

BAD IDEAS:
- Events being different than how they were envisioned
	- Because that in itself is a vision, which is the same as envisioned.
	
The planet's core is unstable and threatened to cause the planet to crack, so a long time ago scientists created a gigantic internal shield to stabilize it.  The shield is on the verge of breaking, and Oracle (the Cyborg) needs to find a way to fix it.  The shield's existence also explains the cold climate.

If the shield breaks, it would result in a huge explosion.  The big villain is planning on using the energy from the explosion to create a time machine for his own use.

The creatures are all hostile due to them all being brainwashed by the villain.
