How I made a new level:
- made new Scene, saved in scenes/levels
- swapped camera with Main Camera prefeab
- put prefab from Tiled2Unity into the level, then did these (to object in inspector, DO NOT DIRECTLY CHANGE THE PREFAB)
	- position is 0, numTilesHigh (so that bottom left corner of the map is at 0,0)
	- set Tag to Map
	- set SortingLayer of bg to Platforms, OrderInLayer to 0
	- set SortingLayer of tile_layer_1 to Platforms, OrderInLayer to 1
	- in Collision of tile_layer_1:
		- added PlatformEffector2D, UseOneWay unchecked
		- in PolygonCollider2D, check UsedByEffector
- add Level prefab, set appropriate properties
- add some LevelSensors so player can move between levels
- Build Settings -> add open scenes
