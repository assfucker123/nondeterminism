t-O: The annoyance has been dealt with Wally, just in case you doubted me.
t-W: Hey, no doubt here!  
t-W: Although wouldn't Sherivice have simply let us pass in the first place if we just explained why we're here?

t-O: No, he would just have gotten confused.  More time arguing, less time being unconscious on the ground.
t-W: Damn it Oracle, we're on a mission to save this island, not subdue everything we see.
