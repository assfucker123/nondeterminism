t-O: The threat has been taken care of Wally.  As if there was any doubt.
t-W: That was fast!  I was worried for nothing.
t-W: We'll be landing at Seudar Isle shortly.

// extra dialogue?
//t-W: Although wouldn't Sherivice have simply let us pass in the first place if we just explained why we're here?
//t-W: |The Meltdown| affects him too, along with everybody and everything on Seudar Isle.
//t-O: No, he would just have gotten confused.  More time arguing, less time being unconscious on the ground.
//t-W: Damn it Oracle, we're on a mission to save this island, not subdue everything we see.
