Another attempt at the ending of Vision ~ SR

800 years ago:

TRUE SHIT:
- Oracle killing a bunch of guys in the past is really dumb.  This doesn't get undone, it actually happens.  If Oracle "wins" it would be really unsatisfying.
- Final boss (FB) wants to build a time machine to go back 800 years to his family and friends.
- FB is just a kid.  When he uses his dad's instructions to build a time machine, he doesn't realize it only works to moments after the machine was built.
- Oracle touches the Omega Crystal 800 years ago.
- FB freezes himself and Oracle.  After about 800 years pass, they're broken from the ice, float on the water to separate places, then thaw out.  Oracle is discovered by Wally.
- 


OTHER IDEAS:
- 800 years ago, fight between Oracle and FB have nothing to do with the Endoplanetary shield.
- FB is just trying to prevent Oracle from getting to the Omega Crystal.
- When FB fails, and Oracle touches it, he uses a desperate reckless attack that ends up freezing them both.
- Omega Crystal is in a cave underwater.
- FB's job is to guard the Omega Crystal.  Being a kid, he doesn't like it, but he does it anyway.
- Larva Oracle can swim pretty well underwater?
- First chronological appearance of Oracle is her swimming underwater, finding a suit to go into (notably a "basic" suit, without much firepower capabilities).  Her motivation is simply to get the Omega Crystal.
	- No firepower at all?  Fight against FB 800 years ago is passive, with FB accidentally opening the way to the Omega Crystal when trying to fight Oracle.
	- There's a wall separating the fight and the crystal.  FB has an attack that can damage the wall when he's aiming for Oracle, opening the way.

- Ancient Seudarians just left the planet at some point.  Had better things to do.
- Keep all the Ancient Seudarians (except for FB) shrouded in mystery.  Vague designs, only shown as wall art, etc.
- A few were left behind, including the ancestors of Sherivice and Solatia.

JUST NEED A WAY TO ACTUALLY SAVE THE WORLD


OTHER IDEAS:
- Fake name for FB is Weaver.  Uses Seudarian technology to appear to be a godly aether-like entity.
